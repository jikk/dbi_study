\label{sec:evaluation}
\subsection{Usability}
\subsection{Performance}
We compare each DBI tools side by side using several application models. The first model is the no instrumentation model.
This model will be used to see the overhead of the DBI itself. The second model is the instruction counter.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Application Models
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No Instrumentation
		\item Instruction counter
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Naive instruction counter.
			\item Optimized by BB instruction counter
		\end{itemize}
		\item Memory Profiler
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ring-buffer model
			\item Effective address categorization
			\item Ring-buffer + EA categorization
			\item Shadow address calculation
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
