\section{Dynamic Binary Instrumentation}
\label{sec:overview}
In contrast to system VM like VMware and Xen, Dynamic Binary Instrumentation is a process-wide virtualization. It has a relatively-high performance overhead, from 2x to 50x depending on the instrumentation and the analysis. There are 3 major players:PIN, Valgrind, DynamoRIO and each platform has different design philosophies and performance implications.
\subsection{PIN}
Developed by intel, PIN uses ATOM model giving user an abstraction.
\subsection{DynamoRIO}
The unique function of DynamoRIO is that the user can manipulate underlying machine code.
\subsection{Valgrind}
Valgrind initially translates application's machine code to a unique Intermediate Representation.
