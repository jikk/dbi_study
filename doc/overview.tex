In contrast to system VM like VMware and Xen, Dynamic Binary Instrumentation is a process-wide virtualization. It has a relatively-high performance overhead, from 2x to 50x depending on the instrumentation and the analysis. There are 3 major players:PIN, Valgrind, DynamoRIO and each platform has different design philosophies and performance implications.
