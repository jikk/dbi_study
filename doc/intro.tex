\section {Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}
There has been several DBIs but there is no work that has compared each DBI side by side. In this work we will provide guidelines and recommendations to developers who want to build security analysis tools. Three major players: PIN\cite{Luk:2005:PBC:1065010.1065034}, Valgrind\cite{Nethercote:2007:VFH:1250734.1250746}, and DynamoRIO\cite{Bruening:2004:ETC:1087758} will be evaluated on usability, capability, and performance.
