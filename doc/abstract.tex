  % 1) what is the DBI framework and why these are important? -- explain a bit
  % 2) what is the problem? 
  % 3) what did we do?
  % 4) and what is the result thus far?
  Dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) is a general purpose technique that enables
  the development of program analysis tools for unknown binary by facilitating
  automatic low-level instrumentation and this technique has become essential
  building blocks for developing security/monitoring tools.
  We have three big players here. However, we lack in guidelines for ...

  Therefore, we performed comparative study for three popular frameworks of
  PIN, Valgrind, and DynamoRIO which comes with different design principles and
  performance implications. Purpose of our work is to provide guidelines to
  developers who want to develop security analysis tools enhancing these
  frameworks. We carefully examined three different framework according to three
  different aspects -- efficiency, capability, and userbility. Our preliminary
  result suggested that.
